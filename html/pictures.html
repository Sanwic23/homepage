      <h2 class="dotted">
        <p> Summer of 2022 i was doing a house</p>
        <p> cleaning job for a family friend.</p>
        <p> Outside of his house there was an anchor</p>
        <p>  that i thought would be good for a</p>
        <p>picture, especially with the water</p>
        <p>in the background.</p>

        <p> This Picture is of my two good friends. </p>
        <p> We were on a school camping trip in</p>
        <p>10th grade and there was a picture contest. </p>
        <p>i saw the bridge and thought to myself:</p>
        <p>"If the sun sets in the background,</p>
        <p> this will be perfect for the competition.</p>

        <p> This Picture is one i took outside of an  </p>
        <p>amusement park called High Chaparal.</p>
        <p>The inspiration for the picture was simply</p>
        <p>that i wanted to take a picture where i </p>
        <p>use sand for a smoke effect and use</p>
        <p>my dad as the person in the picture.</p>
